 Welcome to my GitHub page!
My name is Juan, and I’m excited to begin this new chapter in my life. I’ve recently transitioned into the tech space after working in a variety of roles, including car sales, the cleaning industry, the insurance industry, and even the trailer business industry. Through all those experiences, one thing I’ve learned is that what’s meant to be will always find its way—so here I am.

From a young age, I always envisioned myself working in technology. I even dabbled in coding and taught myself a few programming languages. But as life unfolded, responsibilities took over, and I found myself stuck in a cycle of working just to get by. After taking time to reflect on what I truly wanted, I rediscovered my passion for tech—this time with a deeper appreciation.

Now, the idea of diving into configurations, setting up networks, or uncovering vulnerabilities in systems excites me in a way I never imagined before. This journey has become my happy place, and I’m looking forward to continuing to grow in this field
